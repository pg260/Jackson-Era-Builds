Property requirements for voting have largely been abolished, bringing thousands of white laborers and small farmers into the electorate for the first time.

The Second Bank of the United States controls credit and currency, stabilizing the economy while concentrating financial influence. Jackson views the Bank as an engine of privilege, favoring the wealthy Northeast over the agrarian South and West./nIn 1833, he acts. Jackson vetoes the renewal of the Bank’s charter on political grounds, expanding presidential authority and igniting the conflict known as the Bank War. The nation polarizes, and opposition consolidates into the Whig Party, which denounces Jackson as 'King Andrew I'./nExpected Outcome: The Bank is dismantled. Financial instability follows, contributing to the Panic of 1837. The crisis is severe, but the Republic endures./nObjective: The Saboteur is exploiting economic fear to incite class-based violence and attacks on financial institutions. Keep the conflict political.
